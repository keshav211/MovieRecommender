        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   For one, it does not take into consideration the popularity of a movie. Therefore, a movie with a rating of 9 from 10 voters will be considered 'better' than a movie with a rating of 8.9 from 10,000 voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "> For example, imagine you want to order Chinese food, you have a couple of options, one restaurant has a 5-star rating by only 5 people while the other restaurant has 4.5 ratings by 1000 people. Which restaurant would you prefer? The second one, right?\n",
        "\n",
        "> Of course, there could be an exception that the first restaurant opened just a few days ago; hence, fewer people voted for it while, on the contrary, the second restaurant is operational for a year.\n",
        " \n",
        "*  On a related note, this metric will also tend to favor movies with a smaller number of voters with skewed and/or extremely high ratings. As the number of voters increases, the rating of a movie regularizes and approaches towards a value that is reflective of the movie's quality and gives the user a much better idea as to which movie he/she should choose. While it is difficult to discern the quality of a movie with extremely few voters, you might have to consider external sources to conclude. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Taking these shortcomings into consideration, you must come up with a weighted rating that takes into account the average rating and the number of votes it has accumulated. Such a system will make sure that a movie with a 9 rating from 100,000 voters gets a (far) higher score than a movie with the same rating but a mere few hundred voters.\n",
